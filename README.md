# SATLLA-0 
SATLLA-0 (aka satllazero) is an Open Source Project dedicated
to a complete design of Pico-Satellites.
The overall vision is to allow researchers as well as 12K to be able to 
construct a fully operational pico satellite model - which is based on a proven design
Which is fully operational in space (see SATLLA-2, https://tinygs.com/satellite/SATLLA-2B).
The  SATLLA-0 project include both: software and hardware the pico satellite (and ground station).
The project vision is to allow any science class (in high school or University) to experience “new space”  in a fraction of the price of existing solutions.
