# Summary
Nanosatellites are becoming a preferred platform for testing innovative technologies and conducting academic research in space. Flight Software (FSW) is software that runs on a processor embedded in the satellite body. The software is responsible for managing satellite activity, data processing, and satellite health and safety, thus enabling the satellite to perform all actions necessary to achieve its scientific objective. 

SATLLA-0 is an open source platform for building and experimenting with laboratory nanosatellites for academics and school students. The platform is based on the flight software of the SATLLA-2B satellite, developed and built by the NanoSatellite Research Laboratory of Ariel University. The SATLLA-2B satellite was successfully launched on January 13, 2022 aboard a Falcon 9 launch vehicle.

SATLLA-0 is divided into three main libraries, with the main library, Master, responsible for the ongoing operation of the satellite, the OBC library responsible for the operation of the satellite's research objective, and the Ground Station library responsible for transmitting telecommand to the satellite and receiving satellite transmissions and routing the data for further analysis.
